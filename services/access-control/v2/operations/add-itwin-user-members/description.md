Add or Invite new iTwin user members. Users which are external (i.e. not in the same organization as the iTwin) are not automatically added to the iTwin. Instead, they're invited. Users which are not external, are immediately added as members on the iTwin.

Invited individuals will recieve an invitation via Email, where they'll be prompted to accept the invitation. Upon accepting, they'll then become a member of the iTwin.

The total number of roles assigned in this request must not exceed 50. This can be achieved with many different configurations. For example, 1 role can be assigned to 50 users, or 5 roles can be assigned to 10 users, both resulting in 50 role assignments.
