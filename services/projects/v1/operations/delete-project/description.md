Example: john.doe@example.com is an Organization Administrator that works for Example Industries that has an account with Bentley. John will be able to delete any project that belongs to Example Industries. 

An Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

A user that is not affiliated with an Organization can delete projects that are owned by the user account.  
Example: jane.doe@gmail.com is an independent contractor that does not have an account with Bentley. Jane will be able to delete any project that belongs to Jane. Jane owns any project that she created.
