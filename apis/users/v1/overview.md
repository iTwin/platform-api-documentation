## Users API

The Users API provides the ability to retrieve the user profile for a signed in user.

A Bentley user account is required to use Bentley services. A developer needs to sign in to their Bentley account in order to try an API or register an application in the iTwin Platform portal. An end user of an iTwin Platform application must sign in to their Bentley account in order to establish their identity and authorize access to their data.

A user account is associated with a single organization or company. The Users API provides the ability to manage the users in an organization. A Bentley user account includes a user profile which contains information about a user's name, contact information, and language preference. The Users API provides an endpoint to retrieve information from a user's profile.
