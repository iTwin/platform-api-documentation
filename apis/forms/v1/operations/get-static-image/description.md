Gets a link to a static image to be displayed in a form. The 'fileId' parameter should match the 'fileId' property of a static image control in the form's definition.  It will be a positive integer.  This endpoint returns only a _links object containing the URL of the actual file, which is publicly, though temporarily, available at that address and can be set as the 'src' attribute of an HTML <img> tag to display the image.
