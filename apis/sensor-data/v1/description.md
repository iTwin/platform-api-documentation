The Sensor Data Service (SDS) provides a unified method for publishing time series sensor data (and related metadata) within iTwin IoT. The SDS simplifies the process of connecting sensor data from sources including IoT Devices, IaaS IoT Hubs, Enterprise Systems, and other generic repositories. Availability of this data enables developers, vendors, and users to develop OT workflows to create new use cases for digital twins in their projects.
