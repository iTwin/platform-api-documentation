### Authorization
If a user is affiliated with an Organization, then the user must be an Organization Administrator in order to create a project.  The new project will be owned by the Organization.   
Example: john.doe@example.com is an Organization Administrator that works for Example Industries that has an account with Bentley. John will be able to create projects and those projects will belong to Example Industries. John and any other Organization Administrator for Example Industries will be able to update or delete the project.

An Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator. For more information about User Management please visit our Bentley Communities [Licensing, Cloud, and Web Services](https://communities.bentley.com/communities/other_communities/licensing_cloud_and_web_services/w/wiki/50711/user-management-2-0) wiki page.

Any user that is not affiliated with an Organization can create a project. The new project will be owned by the user account.   
Example: jane.doe@gmail.com is an independent contractor that does not have an account with Bentley. Jane will be able to create projects and those projects will belong to Jane. Only Jane will be able to update or delete the project.
