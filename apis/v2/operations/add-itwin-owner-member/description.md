Add new iTwin owner members. iTwin Owners are users which have full control over the iTwin. Each owner is granted all permissions on the iTwin, allowing them to perform any action on the iTwin they own.

Users which are external (i.e. not in the same organization as the iTwin) are not automatically added to the iTwin. Instead, they're invited. Users which are not external, are immediately added as members on the iTwin.

Invited individuals will recieve an invitation via Email, where they'll be prompted to accept the invitation. Upon accepting, they'll then become a member of the iTwin.
