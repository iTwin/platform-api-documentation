## Digital component library API

Components Center is a cloud-based digital component library and catalog management service. It allows users to efficiently manage their digital component libraries while providing their designers with approved, proprietary components as well as manufacturer's content via subscriptions. The geometry and rich data associated with the components are available for use in all phases of the component's lifecycle. The Digital Library API provides the ability to retrieve digital components and catalogs.
