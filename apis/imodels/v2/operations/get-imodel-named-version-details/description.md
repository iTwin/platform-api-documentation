Retrieves the details of a Named Version.

Every [Changeset](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/glossary/#changeset) on the timeline creates a new version of the iModel. However, some points on the timeline can represent important milestones or significant events to be saved. iModelHub provides a way to mark a point on the timeline with a name. These time points are referred to as Named Versions.
